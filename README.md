# checkbox-js

a simple checkbox is created using JavaScript and the browser's localStaorge.

So you can save your checklist through the browser. Even if you refresh the page.

You can select all the checklist items you want by:

Checking one of the checklist items, then holding down the CTRL key while checking the lower checklist items.

I'm pretty sure, there are flaws in this simple program. Be it in terms of appearance, features, or something else.
